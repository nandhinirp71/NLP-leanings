##Basic Teminologies Used in NLP

1. Corpus
Group of available text data points or it is also refereed to a paragraph of text.

2. Documents
Individual sentence in the data set.

3. Vocabulary
Total number of Unique words in the dataset.

4. Words
Individual words in the dataset.


One Hot Encoding
One-Hot Encoding is a technique used in machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert categorical variables (non-numeric data) into a numerical format that can be used in algorithms. It transforms each category into a binary vector, where:

* 1 represents the presence of a specific category, and
* 0 represents the absence of other categories.

How One-Hot Encoding Works:
Consider a categorical variable color with the following categories: ["red", "blue", "green"].

Using one-hot encoding, this variable can be represented as:

Color	 Red	 Blue	Green
Red	   1	   0	  0
Blue	 0	   1	  0
Green	 0	   0	  1

For each unique category, a new binary column is created. In this case:

* "Red" is represented as [1, 0, 0],
* "Blue" as [0, 1, 0],
* "Green" as [0, 0, 1].

Advantages of OHE:
i. Simple to Implement
ii. Intuitive (Easy to Understand)

Disadvantages of OHE:
i. Creates Sparse Matrix (matrix with more zeroes)
